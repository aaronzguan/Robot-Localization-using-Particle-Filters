# Robot Localization using Particle Filters

This is the homework in CMU 16833-Robot Localization and Mapping. We sovled the robot localization problem using the Mote Carlo Localization (MCL) alogrithm/particle filter localization. The implementation of motion model, sensor model, and low variance resampling are exactly the same as the algorithm in [1]
